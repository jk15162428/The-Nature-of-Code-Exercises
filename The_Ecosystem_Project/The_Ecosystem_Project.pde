/*
Develop a set of rules for simulating the real-world behavior of a creature, 
such as a nervous fly, swimming fish, hopping bunny, slithering snake, etc. 
Can you control the objectâ€™s motion by only manipulating the acceleration? 
Try to give the creature a personality through its behavior 
(rather than through its visual design).
